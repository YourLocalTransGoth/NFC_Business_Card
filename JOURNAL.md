## 10/13/2025 11:24 PM - PCB schematic

I made the schematic pretty quickly. After doing this for the second time, I understood the program better. This schematic is pretty basic, with one LED, one resistor, one capacitor, one NFC chip, and one NFC antenna. I was hoping to use a different colored LED, but I didn't know that different colored LEDs require more or less power.  

## 10/13/2025 11:29 PM - Routed the PCB and started to design

Converted to a PCB! I routed the components and started to design.

I was updating my friend during the process, and he was pointing out errors for me that I couldn't find. The program I am using is annoying, but also simple, it doesn't let me do some things, and I have to mess around with it.
