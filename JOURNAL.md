## 10/13/2025 - PCB schematic  

![Capture.PNG](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjE2OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2444b6cf0539740841051b2e1065e82a9c9e9dbb/Capture.PNG)

I made the schematic pretty quickly. After doing this for the second time, I understood the program better. This schematic is pretty basic, with one LED, one resistor, one capacitor, one NFC chip, and one NFC antenna. I was hoping to use a different colored LED, but I didn't know that different colored LEDs require more or less power.
